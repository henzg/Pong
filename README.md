HI! If you are reading this you have found my Pong game made in SFML/CPP! 
If you are reading this, just know this was done in a few hours so the code isnt.... great!
Feel free to browse the code, I am working on cleaning it up and making it more OOP with some enhancments. Hopefully will have some install instructions soon so you too can try my amature SFML game :).
More to come!
